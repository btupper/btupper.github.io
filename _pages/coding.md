### [IDL](https://www.l3harrisgeospatial.com/Software-Technology/IDL) and [PV-Wave](https://www.perforce.com/products/pv-wave)

My dive into programming was with IDL/PV-Wave.  At the time (early 1990s) they were the identical, but soon development of each diverged.  I studied under [Kirk Maasche](https://umaine.edu/earthclimate/people/kirk-maasch/), where I used PV-Wave to reconstruct the recent discharge history of the Mackenzie River. Later I worked for [Maine Department of Marine Resources](https://www.maine.gov/dmr/) where I used IDL extensively for marine habitat mapping and analyses.  Finally, I used IDL for marine studies and image analysis for the study of plankton at the [Center for Aquatic Cytometry](https://www.bigelow.org/services/fac/). [David Fanning](http://www.idlcoyote.com/) was instrumental in both my professional and personal development.

### [ImageJ](https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/)

At Bigelow we replaced commercially licensed software for image analysis, like IDL, with ImageJ which is in the public domain. Our primary effort was to analyze [FlowCam](https://www.fluidimaging.com/products) output data.

### [LabView](https://www.ni.com/en-us/shop/labview.html)

We used LabView to develop a remote collaboratory in which students at Fullerton College in California remotely operated laboratory equipment located in our lab in West Boothbay Harbor, Maine. We also developed a submersible marine snow recorder where image acquisitions and analyses were in LabView.

#### [R programming language](https://www.r-project.org/)

I was introduced to R by [Philippe Grossjean](https://phgrosjean.sciviews.org/) and his student Kevin Denis for use with what would become the [zooimage](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/zooimage/index.html) R package. Since then we have used R for a general purpose language running RESTful clients, workflow management, ecological modeling, genomic analyses and spatial analyses. There are many R packages that I have either developed in whole or part here [BLOS-github](https://github.com/BigelowLab).
