Ahoy! I have work with a variety of groups at [BLOS](https://www.bigelow.org/) including [The Center for Aquatic Cytometry](https://www.bigelow.org/services/fac/), [The Single Cell Genomics Center](https://scgc.bigelow.org/) and most recently [The Tandy Center of Ocean Forecasting](https://www.bigelow.org/services/ocean-forecasting/).

Most of my work involves developing software workflows that include data acquisition, manipulation, analysis and archival. Currently I program in [R programming language](https://www.r-project.org/) and [shell](https://www.learnshell.org/), but I also have experience with [Python](https://www.python.org/), [Java](https://www.java.com/en/), [LabView](https://www.ni.com/en-us/shop/labview.html) and the venerable [IDL](https://www.l3harrisgeospatial.com/Software-Technology/IDL).
